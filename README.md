# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. This project includes my development environment and the
setup I use on macOS.

## Requirements

* macOS
* Terminal app

## Usage

Clone or download this repo and execute the following script:

    ./dotfiles.sh

It will install Command Line tools, Homebrew, Ansible and then will run the
setup playbook.
